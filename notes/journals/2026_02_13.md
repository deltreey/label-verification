# Process
1. Pull up application
2. Examine label artwork
3. Verify label matches application
a) Brand name
b) ABV
c) Government warning

150,000 label applications/yr

COLA (2003) is an improvement over paper https://www.ttb.gov/regulated-commodities/labeling/colas
5-10 minutes for simple applications
- Would like to optimize and use AI for the basics and escalate more complicated stuff
- Scanning vendor pilot was a disaster
  - 30-40 seconds per label
  - agents could do 5 labels in the time it took the machine to do 1
  - 5 seconds or less or no one will use it
  
  Tool must be remarkably simple: 73 year old who just learned how video calls work.  Half the team is over 50
  
  During peak, big importers will dump 200-300 apps all at once.  Handling batch uploads would be a huge benefit.
- Infrastructure is Azure
  COLA is .NET
  Not looking for COLA integration
  Looking for a PoC
  Be careful of PII, Document Retention, and General Federal Compliance, but don't get crazy, just plan for it.
  
  Outbound Traffic is likely blocked, so cloud APIs are probably unavailable.
  - Previously mentioned pilot had half their features broken because of this
  
  Careful of raw pattern match.  Things like case sensitivity are incorrect.  Some level of "judgement" is required.
- Jenny Park has a printed checklist for every label **GET THAT LIST**
- The government warning must be exact, word-for-word and "GOVERNMENT WARNING:" must be in all caps and bold...how do we check bold with an image processor?
- Some images need pre-processing, skew/brightness, even glare removal
- # TTB Label Requirements
  varies by type
  - Brand name (Captain John's)
  - Class/type designation (Rum with natural flavors added) -- there's a lot here.
  - Alcohol content (20% alcohol by volume 40 proof) -- *exceptions for certain wine/beer
  - Net contents (750ml)
  - Name and address of the bottler/producer (can be embossed/blown on the container) 
  - Country of origin (imports)
  - Government Health Warning Statement
  ttb.gov has list of requirements
  - interesting case: updating labels is allowed without new apps in certain cases
  this is complex

  ## Wine
  - delcaration of sulfites (10 or more ppmillion sulfur dioxide)
  - ">14% it is mandatory." "<14% it is optional if the type is table wine or light wine on the label"
  
  ## Beer
  - Distinctive Name is not required if the product is a well-known name, requires an approved formula
  - alcohol content only required if derived from additives, not hops
  
  ## Distilled
  - Distinctive Name (if requires a statement of composition)
